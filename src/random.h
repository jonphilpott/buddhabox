/**
 * @file random.h
 * @brief LFSR-based random number generator for non-audio randomness.
 *
 * While WhiteNoise in noise.h is optimized for generating audio-rate noise
 * signals, this LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) is designed for
 * "decision-making" randomness:
 *   - Picking random notes from a scale
 *   - Deciding whether to trigger an event (probability gates)
 *   - Generating random parameter values (filter cutoff, delay time, etc.)
 *   - Shuffling sequence patterns
 *
 * HOW AN LFSR WORKS:
 * ──────────────────
 * An LFSR is a shift register where the input bit is computed by XOR-ing
 * selected "tap" positions from the current state. Think of it like a
 * scrambler — each step shifts all bits left by one and feeds back a
 * combination of bits to the input.
 *
 * The tap positions (31, 21, 1, 0 for our 32-bit version) are chosen so
 * that the register cycles through ALL possible non-zero states before
 * repeating — a "maximal length" sequence of 2^32 - 1 values.
 *
 * LFSRs are extremely fast (just shifts and XORs) and produce decent
 * pseudo-randomness for our purposes, though they wouldn't pass rigorous
 * statistical tests. For generative music, that's perfectly fine.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   LFSR rng(42);
 *
 *   // Pick a random note from a pentatonic scale
 *   uint8_t pentatonic[] = {60, 62, 64, 67, 69};  // C D E G A
 *   uint8_t note = pentatonic[rng.nextRange(0, 4)];
 *
 *   // 30% probability gate
 *   bool trigger = rng.nextFloat() < 0.3f;
 *
 *   // Random filter cutoff between 200 and 2000 Hz
 *   float cutoff = 200.0f + rng.nextFloat() * 1800.0f;
