 * @brief Low Pass Gate (LPG) — combined VCA and lowpass filter on one CV.
 *
 * The Low Pass Gate is one of Don Buchla's most iconic inventions. It
 * combines a voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) and a lowpass filter into
 * a single circuit driven by one control signal. As the gate opens:
 *
 *   - The VCA gain rises (louder)
 *   - The filter cutoff rises (brighter)
 *
 * Both happen simultaneously from the same control voltage, giving the LPG
 * its characteristic sound: notes bloom both in volume AND timbre together,
 * and close together — producing a woody, percussive, organic quality that
 * neither a plain VCA nor a plain filter alone can replicate.
 *
 * VACTROL SIMULATION:
 * ───────────────────
 * The original Buchla LPG used a *vactrol* — an optocoupler (LED +
 * light-dependent resistor) as the control element. Vactrols have a slow
 * physical response: the LDR takes time to react to the LED changing
 * brightness. This asymmetric slew (faster opening, slower closing) is a
 * major part of the LPG's sound — it gives notes a percussive attack and
 * a lingering, natural decay.
 *
 * This implementation models the vactrol with a one-pole lowpass smoother
 * on the control signal. The slew time can be tuned with setSlewTime().
 * Asymmetric rise/fall times can be set using setSlewRise()/setSlewFall().
 *
 * FILTER IMPLEMENTATION:
 * ──────────────────────
 * A one-pole lowpass filter is used internally rather than the SVFilter.
 * This is intentional: the original Buchla LPG has a gentle 6 dB/octave
 * rolloff (one pole), not a steep 12 or 24 dB/octave response. The single
 * pole gives a smooth, musical timbral transition as the gate opens.
 *
 * Example usage — triggered by an envelope:
 *   LowPassGate lpg;
 *   lpg.setSlewTime(0.04f);   // 40 ms vactrol-style lag
 *   Envelope env;
 *   env.setAttack(0.005f);
 *   env.setRelease(0.3f);
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   env.gate(triggered);
 *   lpg.setControl(env.process());
 *   float out = lpg.process(osc.process());
 *
 * Example usage — LFO-driven (tremolo with timbral shift):
 *   LowPassGate lpg;
 *   LFO lfo;
 *   lfo.setFrequency(2.0f);
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float cv = mapf(lfo.process(), -1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
 *   lpg.setControl(cv);
 *   float out = lpg.process(osc.process());
