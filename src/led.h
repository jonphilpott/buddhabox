 * @brief Driver for the onboard user LED (PC13) on the Black Pill.
 *
 * The STM32F401CC Black Pill has a single user-controllable LED wired to
 * pin PC13. The LED is ACTIVE LOW: driving the pin LOW turns it ON, and
 * driving it HIGH turns it OFF. This is a common STM32 board convention
 * — the LED cathode connects to the GPIO pin, and the anode is pulled to
 * 3.3V through a resistor.
 *
 * This class provides:
 *   - Instant on / off / toggle control.
 *   - Non-blocking blink at a configurable interval (driven by update()).
 *   - A clean way to signal firmware status without touching audio code.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — DO NOT CALL FROM AUDIO ISR:
 * digitalWrite() and millis() are not safe inside the DMA audio callback.
 * Call update() from loop() only.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   UserLED led;
 *
 *   void setup() {
 *       led.begin();
 *       led.blink(500);  // Blink every 500 ms while audio initialises
 *   }
 *
 *   void loop() {
 *       led.update();    // Must be called each loop to service blink
 *   }
