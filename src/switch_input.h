/**
 * @file switch_input.h
 * @brief Debounced digital switch input with trigger/hold/release detection.
 *
 * Reads a momentary switch (or button) wired to ground and provides
 * clean, debounced event signals — a pressed trigger, a released
 * trigger, and a held-down state query. Designed for controlling:
 *
 *   - Envelope gates: sustain a note while held, release on lift
 *   - One-shot triggers: fire an envelope, advance a sequence step
 *   - Toggle events: flip between modes on each press
 *   - Manual mixItUp() calls: trigger a scene change from hardware
 *
 * WIRING (active-low with internal pull-up):
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Connect one leg of the switch to the GPIO pin, the other leg to
 * GND. The internal pull-up resistor holds the pin HIGH when the
 * switch is open, and the switch pulls it LOW when pressed.
 *
 *   3.3V ──[internal pull-up]── PA1 ──┤ switch ├── GND
 *
 * This is the simplest possible wiring: no external resistors needed.
 * Call begin() in setup() to configure the pin as INPUT_PULLUP.
 *
 * WHY DEBOUNCING IS NECESSARY:
 * ────────────────────────────
 * Mechanical switches have tiny metal contacts that physically bounce
 * when they make or break contact. In the first ~5–20ms after a press,
 * the signal can flutter between HIGH and LOW dozens of times. Without
 * debouncing, a single button press can register as many presses.
 *
 * We use a time-based approach with millis():
 *   1. Track when the raw pin reading last changed.
 *   2. Only accept the reading as "settled" if it has been stable for
 *      at least debounce_ms milliseconds.
 *   3. Once settled, update the canonical state and fire the
 *      appropriate one-shot trigger flag.
 *
 * This is more robust than a counter-based approach because it works
 * correctly regardless of how often update() is called.
 *
 * CALLING FROM THE AUDIO CALLBACK:
 * ──────────────────────────────────
 * triggered() and released() are safe to call from the audio callback
 * (ISR context). They read and clear a single bool flag. On ARM
 * Cortex-M4, bool reads and writes are atomic — no locking needed.
 * update() must only be called from loop(), as digitalRead() is
 * not suitable for ISR use.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   SwitchInput btn(PA1);         // Switch on PA1, default 20ms debounce
 *
 *   void setup() {
 *       btn.begin();              // Configure pin as INPUT_PULLUP
 *   }
 *
 *   void loop() {
 *       btn.update();             // Must be called regularly from loop()
 *       delay(10);
 *   }
 *
 *   // In audio callback — gate a note envelope:
 *   if (btn.triggered()) {
 *       env.trigger();            // Attack on press
 *   }
 *   if (btn.released()) {
 *       env.release();            // Release on lift (if envelope supports it)
 *   }
 *   // Or: hold gate open while pressed (for sustain-style envelopes):
 *   float gate = btn.isHeld() ? 1.0f : 0.0f;

   * Example:

   *   SwitchInput btn2(PB3, 50);     // Noisier switch, longer window
