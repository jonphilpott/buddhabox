/**
 * @file noise.h
 * @brief White and pink noise generators for the BuddhaBox DSP framework.
 *
 * Noise is fundamental to ambient/generative audio. It provides:
 *   - Texture and warmth (filtered pink noise = wind, ocean, breath)
 *   - Excitation for resonant filters (noise → filter = singing bowls, drones)
 *   - The "pluck" energy for Karplus-Strong string synthesis
 *   - Random modulation when fed into control parameters
 *
 * WHITE NOISE vs PINK NOISE:
 * ──────────────────────────
 * White noise has equal energy at every frequency — it sounds harsh and
 * "hissy" like a TV tuned to static. The high frequencies dominate
 * because there are more high-frequency bands per octave.
 *
 * Pink noise has equal energy per *octave* — it rolls off at -3 dB/octave,
 * sounding much more natural and soothing. Rain, waterfalls, and wind are
 * approximately pink noise. It's the go-to for ambient texture.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   PinkNoise noise(12345);    // Seed determines the random sequence
 *   SVFilter filter;
 *   filter.setFrequency(400.0f);
 *   filter.setResonance(0.6f);
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float n = noise.process() * 0.3f;   // Pink noise, reduced volume
 *   filter.process(n);
 *   float out = filter.lowpass();        // Warm, filtered noise

/**
 * White noise generator using xorshift32 PRNG.
 *
 * HOW XORSHIFT WORKS:
 * This is a very fast pseudo-random number generator that uses only XOR
 * and bit-shift operations — no multiplication or division. It produces
 * a sequence of 2^32 - 1 values before repeating, which at 44100 Hz
 * would take about 27 hours. Good enough for our purposes!
 *
 * The three shift amounts (13, 17, 5) were chosen by George Marsaglia
 * to produce maximal-length sequences with good statistical properties.
 *
 * Example:
 *   WhiteNoise noise;
 *   float sample = noise.process(); // Returns random value in [-1, +1]

/**
 * Pink noise generator using the Voss-McCartney algorithm.
 *
 * HOW VOSS-McCARTNEY WORKS:
 * ─────────────────────────
 * Pink noise needs -3 dB/octave rolloff. The clever trick here is to
 * maintain a set of "rows" (random values), where each row is updated
 * at a different rate:
 *
 *   Row 0: updated every sample     (represents highest octave)
 *   Row 1: updated every 2 samples  (next octave down)
 *   Row 2: updated every 4 samples  (two octaves down)
 *   Row 3: updated every 8 samples  ...and so on
 *
 * The output is the sum of all rows. Because lower rows change less
 * frequently, they contribute lower-frequency content — and since each
 * row contributes equally, we get equal energy per octave = pink noise.
 *
 * Which row to update is determined by the lowest set bit of a counter.
 * This is a very efficient O(1) operation per sample.
 *
 * With 12 rows, we cover about 12 octaves of pink-ness, which spans
 * the full audible range at 44.1 kHz.
 *
 * Example:
 *   PinkNoise pink(54321);
 *   float sample = pink.process(); // Returns pink noise in [-1, +1]
 */
