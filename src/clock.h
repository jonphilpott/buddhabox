/**
 * @file clock.h
 * @brief Sample-accurate tempo clock for synchronizing events and sequencing.
 *
 * The TempoClock generates regular "tick" events at a specified BPM. You call
 * process() once per audio sample, and it returns true when a tick occurs.
 * Use these ticks to drive:
 *
 *   - Note changes in a generative sequence
 *   - LFO resets (sync LFO phase to the beat)
 *   - Probability-based events ("30% chance of changing note each beat")
 *   - Step sequencer advances
 *   - Rhythmic volume gates (tremolo synced to tempo)
 *
 * WHY SAMPLE-ACCURATE TIMING?
 * ──────────────────────────
 * You might think: "why not just use millis() in loop()?" Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. PRECISION: millis() has ~1ms resolution. At 120 BPM, a quarter note
 *      is 500ms — a 1ms error is 0.2%. But for faster divisions (sixteenth
 *      notes = 125ms), the error becomes audible as "jitter" or "sloppiness".
 *
 *   2. SYNCHRONIZATION: The audio callback runs at exact sample intervals.
 *      By counting samples instead of wall-clock time, our tick events are
 *      perfectly aligned with the audio stream. A note that starts on a tick
 *      will start at the exact right sample — no latency or drift.
 *
 * DIVISIONS:
 * ──────────
 * The division parameter controls how many ticks per beat:
 *   1 = quarter notes (one tick per beat)
 *   2 = eighth notes (two ticks per beat)
 *   4 = sixteenth notes (four ticks per beat)
 *   3 = triplets (three ticks per beat)
 *   8 = thirty-second notes (eight ticks per beat)
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   TempoClock clock(72.0f, 1);  // 72 BPM, quarter notes
 *   LFSR rng(42);
 *   uint8_t scale[] = {60, 62, 64, 67, 69};  // C pentatonic
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   if (clock.process()) {
 *       // This runs once per beat — pick a new note
 *       uint8_t note = scale[rng.nextRange(0, 4)];
 *       osc.setFrequency(midiToFreq(note));
 *   }
 *   float sample = osc.process();
