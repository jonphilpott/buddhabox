 * @brief Audio-rate oscillator with sine, saw, square, and triangle waveforms.
 *
 * This is the bread-and-butter of any synthesizer — it generates periodic
 * waveforms at audible frequencies. You set a frequency (in Hz) and a waveform
 * shape, then call process() once per sample to get the next output value.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS — The Phase Accumulator Pattern:
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Instead of tracking time in seconds, we maintain a "phase" variable that
 * ramps from 0.0 to 1.0, then wraps back to 0.0. One full 0→1 cycle = one
 * period of the waveform. The speed of this ramp determines the pitch:
 *
 *   phaseIncrement = frequency / sampleRate
 *
 * For example, at 440 Hz and 44100 sample rate:
 *   phaseIncrement = 440 / 44100 ≈ 0.00998
 *   (phase advances ~1% per sample, completing one cycle in ~100 samples)
 *
 * We then use the phase value to compute the waveform shape. This approach
 * is elegant because:
 *   1. It works for any frequency without needing a lookup table per pitch
 *   2. The phase stays in a clean 0–1 range (no growing numbers over time)
 *   3. It's trivial to reset, sync, or modulate the phase
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   Oscillator osc;
 *   osc.setWaveform(Waveform::SAW);
 *   osc.setFrequency(440.0f);    // Concert A
 *   osc.setAmplitude(0.5f);      // Half volume
 *
 *   // In your audio callback:
 *   float sample = osc.process(); // Returns -0.5 to +0.5

/**
 * Waveform type selector.
 *
 * Each shape has a distinct sonic character:
 *   SINE     — Pure tone, no harmonics. Smooth and mellow.
 *   SAW      — All harmonics (1/n amplitude). Bright and buzzy.
 *   SQUARE   — Odd harmonics only (1/n amplitude). Hollow, clarinet-like.
 *   TRIANGLE — Odd harmonics only (1/n² amplitude). Softer than square.
 *
 * HARMONIC CONTENT NOTE: In digital audio, these "naive" waveforms will
 * produce aliasing at higher frequencies because the sharp edges contain
 * harmonics above the Nyquist frequency (sampleRate/2). For this ambient
 * project that's generally fine — we're often using low frequencies and
 * filtering the output anyway. For a production synth you'd want
 * band-limited versions (PolyBLEP, wavetable, etc.).

   * HOW THIS WORKS:
   * A sine wave looks a lot like an upside-down parabola near its peaks.
   * We exploit this by computing y = (4/π)x - (4/π²)x|x| which gives a
   * rough sine shape, then apply a correction pass to improve accuracy.
   *
   * The result is accurate to within ~0.1% — more than enough for audio
   * where we can't hear the difference. On the STM32F4 this runs about
   * 4x faster than the standard library sinf().
