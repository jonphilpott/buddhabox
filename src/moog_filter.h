 * @brief 4-pole Moog ladder filter approximation with resonance.
 *
 * The Moog ladder filter, designed by Dr. Robert Moog in 1965, is perhaps
 * the most iconic filter in electronic music history. Its warm, musical
 * character comes from two key properties:
 *
 *   1. FOUR POLES: Four one-pole lowpass stages in series give a steep
 *      24 dB/octave rolloff — twice as steep as the SVFilter's 12 dB/oct.
 *      This produces a much more dramatic "closing" effect when the cutoff
 *      is swept down.
 *
 *   2. NONLINEARITY: Each transistor stage in the original circuit softly
 *      saturates at high levels, generating warm even harmonics. We
 *      approximate this with a fast tanh-like function at the input stage.
 *
 * HOW THE LADDER WORKS:
 * ─────────────────────
 * Each one-pole stage is a simple leaky integrator:
 *
 *   s[n] += g * (input_n - s[n])
 *
 * Think of it like a capacitor charging toward its input. The coefficient
 * g controls the charge rate: high g (high cutoff) = fast tracking, low g
 * (low cutoff) = slow, sluggish response.
 *
 * Four stages are chained in series, with the last stage's output fed back
 * (negated) to the input by the resonance factor k:
 *
 *   IN → softclip → [s0] → [s1] → [s2] → [s3] → OUT
 *                     ↑                     │
 *                     └──── k × feedback ───┘
 *
 * At k=0: pure lowpass, no resonance.
 * At k≈4: the feedback exactly replaces what the filter attenuates at the
 *          cutoff frequency — the loop sustains itself and the filter rings.
 *
 * NONLINEARITY (the "Moog sound"):
 * ─────────────────────────────────
 * Before entering stage 0, the combined input+feedback is run through
 * softclip (x / (1 + |x|), a fast tanh approximation). This does two
 * things:
 *   - Bounds the feedback loop at high resonance, preventing runaway.
 *   - Adds warm harmonic saturation — the same "analogue feel" that
 *     makes real Moog filters sound different from clean digital ones.
 *
 * COMPARISON WITH SVFilter:
 * ──────────────────────────
 *   SVFilter   — 12 dB/oct, LP + HP + BP outputs, linear, very stable.
 *   MoogFilter — 24 dB/oct, LP output only, nonlinear character,
 *                self-oscillating resonance, slightly more CPU cost.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE NOTE:
 * ─────────────────
 * The most expensive operation, expf(), is called only in setFrequency()
 * and cached. The per-sample cost is four multiply-add pairs plus one
 * softclip (three operations) — well within budget on the STM32F4 FPU.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   MoogFilter filter;
 *   filter.setFrequency(800.0f);  // 800 Hz cutoff
 *   filter.setResonance(0.7f);    // Strong resonance
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float output = filter.process(inputSample);

   * Set the filter cutoff frequency in Hz.
   *
   * The cutoff is where attenuation begins. Below this frequency, content
   * passes at unity gain. Above it, the rolloff is 24 dB per octave.
   *
   * Internally computes g = 1 - exp(-2π*fc/fs), the one-pole coefficient.
   * expf() is called here — not in the audio loop — and the result is
   * cached. Repeated calls with the same Hz value are detected by exact
   * float comparison and return immediately with no computation.

   * @param hz  Cutoff frequency in Hertz.
   *            Useful range: 20 Hz (almost silent) to ~15000 Hz (open).
   *            Clamped to [20, SAMPLE_RATE * 0.45] for stability.
   *
   * Example:
   *   // Sweep cutoff downward with an LFO for a classic filter sweep:
   *   float mod = lfo.process();
   *   filter.setFrequency(mapf(mod, -1.0f, 1.0f, 80.0f, 8000.0f));

    // When g approaches 1 (high fc), stages track instantly → filter open.

   * Set the filter resonance (Q).

   * rings. At maximum (1.0), the loop sustains itself and the filter
   * self-oscillates, producing a sine wave at the cutoff pitch.
   *
   * The nonlinearity at the input stage keeps self-oscillation bounded —
   * the output stays within roughly ±1.0 even at resonance = 1.0.
   *
   * @param res  Resonance amount, 0.0 to 1.0.

   *             0.8 = strong ringing, musical
   *             1.0 = self-oscillation (pitched sine at cutoff frequency)
   *

   *   filter.setResonance(0.6f);  // Warm Moog character
   *   filter.setResonance(1.0f);  // Self-oscillate as a sine oscillator!
