 * @brief Karplus-Strong plucked string synthesis.
 *
 * Karplus-Strong is one of the most elegant algorithms in computer music:
 * a short burst of noise fed into a delay line with filtered feedback
 * produces a surprisingly realistic plucked string sound. The algorithm
 * was discovered by Alex Strong and refined by Kevin Karplus in 1983.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * ─────────────
 *
 *   1. EXCITE: Fill the delay line with a burst of white noise.
 *      This is the "pluck" — the initial energy that sets the string vibrating.
 *
 *   2. FEEDBACK LOOP: Each sample, read the oldest value from the delay,
 *      pass it through a simple lowpass filter, and write it back.
 *
 *      ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
 *      │                                      │
 *      │  noise burst ──▶ [delay line] ──▶ output
 *      │                    ▲      │
 *      │                    │      ▼
 *      │                    └── lowpass
 *      │                      (averaging)
 *      └──────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 *   3. The delay length determines the pitch:
 *        delaySamples = SAMPLE_RATE / frequency
 *      For A4 (440 Hz): 44100 / 440 ≈ 100.2 samples
 *
 *   4. The lowpass filter causes high frequencies to decay faster than low
 *      frequencies — just like a real string! The result is a tone that
 *      starts bright (the "attack" of the pluck) and mellows over time.
 *
 * WHY IT SOUNDS SO GOOD:
 * ─────────────────────
 * A real vibrating string works almost identically: energy bounces back
 * and forth along the string (the delay line), losing a tiny bit of high
 * frequency content at each reflection (the lowpass filter). Karplus-Strong
 * is essentially a physical model of a string, not just a synthesis trick.
 *
 * DAMPING:
 * ────────
 * The damping parameter (0.0–1.0) controls how quickly the string decays:
 *   0.0 = maximum sustain (rings for a very long time)
 *   0.5 = natural pluck (like a nylon guitar string)
 *   0.9 = very short, muted pluck (like a palm-muted guitar)
 *   1.0 = completely dead (no resonance)
 *
 * Example usage — Simple plucked string:
 *   KarplusStrong string;
 *   string.pluck(midiToFreq(NOTE_C4));   // Pluck at Middle C
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float sample = string.process();
 *
 * Example usage — Generative harp with tempo clock:
 *   KarplusStrong string;
 *   TempoClock clock(90.0f, 2);   // 90 BPM, eighth notes
 *   LFSR rng(42);
 *   uint8_t scale[] = {60, 62, 64, 67, 69};  // C pentatonic
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   if (clock.process()) {
 *       uint8_t note = scale[rng.nextRange(0, 4)];
 *       string.pluck(midiToFreq(note));
 *   }
 *   float sample = string.process();
 *
 * Example usage — Multiple strings for polyphony:
 *   KarplusStrong strings[4];
 *   int nextString = 0;
 *
 *   // Round-robin plucking across 4 strings:
 *   if (clock.process()) {
 *       strings[nextString].pluck(midiToFreq(note));
 *       nextString = (nextString + 1) % 4;
 *   }
 *
 *   // Mix all strings together:
 *   float mix = 0.0f;
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) mix += strings[i].process();
 *   float out = softclip(mix, 1.5f);  // Gentle saturation to tame peaks
