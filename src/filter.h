 * @file filter.h
 * @brief State Variable Filter (SVF) with simultaneous low/high/bandpass
 * outputs.
 *
 * Filters are what transform raw waveforms and noise into musical, sculpted
 * sounds. This SVF implementation gives you three filter types from one
 * process() call:
 *
 *   Lowpass  — Removes high frequencies. Makes things sound "dark", "warm",
 *              "muffled". Like hearing music through a wall.
 *   Highpass — Removes low frequencies. Makes things sound "thin", "bright",
 *              "airy". Like a tinny speaker.
 *   Bandpass — Keeps only frequencies near the cutoff. Creates a focused,
 *              "vocal" or "wah-wah" quality.
 *
 * HOW THE CHAMBERLIN SVF WORKS:
 * ─────────────────────────────
 * The SVF uses two integrators and a feedback path. Each sample, it
 * computes all three filter outputs in sequence:
 *
 *   1. lowpass  += f * bandpass       (integrate bandpass → lowpass)
 *   2. highpass  = input - lowpass - damping * bandpass
 *   3. bandpass += f * highpass       (integrate highpass → bandpass)
 *
 * Where:
 *   f = 2 * sin(π * cutoff / sampleRate)  — controls the cutoff frequency
 *   damping = 2 * (1 - resonance)          — controls the resonance peak
 *
 * The "resonance" parameter creates a peak at the cutoff frequency. At high
 * resonance, the filter starts to ring or "sing" — this is the classic
 * synthesizer filter sweep sound. At maximum resonance, the filter
 * self-oscillates and produces a sine wave at the cutoff frequency.
 *
 * STABILITY NOTE: The Chamberlin SVF becomes unstable when the cutoff
 * frequency approaches the Nyquist frequency (sampleRate/2). We clamp
 * the cutoff to sampleRate/4 to stay safe. For this ambient project,
 * we're typically sweeping in the 100–5000 Hz range anyway.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   SVFilter filter;
 *   filter.setFrequency(800.0f);   // 800 Hz cutoff
 *   filter.setResonance(0.4f);     // Moderate resonance
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   filter.process(inputSample);
 *   float warm = filter.lowpass();     // Use lowpass output
 *   float bright = filter.highpass();  // Or highpass
 *   float focused = filter.bandpass(); // Or bandpass
 *   // You can even mix them!
 *   float notch = filter.lowpass() + filter.highpass(); // Notch filter

   * Set the filter cutoff frequency in Hz.
   *
   * This is the frequency where the filter transitions between passing
   * and rejecting. For a lowpass filter, frequencies below this pass
   * through and frequencies above are attenuated.
   *
   * @param hz  Cutoff frequency in Hertz.
   *            Useful range: 20 Hz (very dark) to ~10000 Hz (barely
   * filtering). Note: clamped to SAMPLE_RATE/4 for stability.
   *
   * Example:
   *   // Sweep cutoff with an LFO for a "breathing" effect
   *   float mod = lfo.process();
   *   float cutoff = mapf(mod, -1.0f, 1.0f, 200.0f, 3000.0f);

    // Early-out if the frequency hasn't changed. sinf() is one of the
    // more expensive operations in the audio callback — this filter is
    // often driven by an LFO, which means setFrequency() gets called
    // once per sample. When the LFO uses a control-rate divider (see
    // lfo.h setDivider()), it returns the exact same float value for N
    // consecutive samples. Identical bits → skip the sinf() entirely.
    //
    // Note: exact float equality is usually a red flag, but here it's
    // intentional and safe — we're comparing against our own cached value
    // that we wrote last time, not comparing two independently-computed
    // results that might round differently.
