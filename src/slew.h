 * @brief Slew limiter with independent rise and fall times.
 *
 * A slew limiter is essentially a one-pole lowpass filter applied to a
 * control signal rather than an audio signal. It limits how fast a value
 * can change — smoothing out abrupt jumps into gradual transitions.
 *
 * In hardware modular synthesis a slew limiter (also called a "lag
 * processor" or "portamento circuit") sits between a CV source and its
 * destination, rounding off sharp edges. In west-coast synthesis it's
 * used heavily for:
 *
 *   PORTAMENTO: smooth pitch glides between notes
 *     Quantizer output (stepped) → SlewLimiter → oscillator frequency
 *
 *   CV SMOOTHING: remove noise or digitisation steps from sensor readings
 *     AnalogInput → SlewLimiter → filter cutoff
 *
 *   ENVELOPE SHAPING: turn a gate signal into a simple AR envelope
 *     TempoClock tick → gate (0/1) → SlewLimiter → VCA gain
 *
 *   FOLLOWER-STYLE EFFECTS: different response for rising vs falling
 *     Audio envelope follower output → SlewLimiter with fast rise,
 *     slow fall → ducking or sidechain effects
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * ─────────────
 * Each sample, the slew limiter moves its output toward the target by a
 * fixed fraction — the classic one-pole IIR formula:
 *
 *   output = coeff * output + (1 - coeff) * target
 *
 * When target > output (rising), we use riseCoeff_.
 * When target < output (falling), we use fallCoeff_.
 *
 * The coefficient is derived from the desired time constant:
 *   coeff = exp(-1.0 / (time_seconds * SAMPLE_RATE))
 *
 * A coefficient close to 1.0 means very slow slewing (nearly frozen).
 * A coefficient near 0.0 means almost instant response (no slewing).
 *
 * Example usage — portamento:
 *   SlewLimiter slew;
 *   slew.setTime(0.05f);   // 50 ms glide time (symmetric)
 *
 *   float targetFreq = midiToFreq(currentNote);
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float freq = slew.process(targetFreq);
 *   osc.setFrequency(freq);
 *   float out = osc.process();
 *
 * Example usage — asymmetric (fast attack, slow release):
 *   SlewLimiter slew;
 *   slew.setSlewRise(0.002f);  // 2 ms rise (punchy)
 *   slew.setSlewFall(0.2f);    // 200 ms fall (lingering)
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float gate = clock.process() ? 1.0f : 0.0f;
 *   float envCV = slew.process(gate);
 *   float out = osc.process() * envCV;
 *
 * Example usage — sensor smoothing:
 *   SlewLimiter slew;
 *   slew.setTime(0.01f);  // 10 ms smoothing
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float smooth = slew.process(analogIn.read());
 *   filter.setFrequency(mapf(smooth, 0.0f, 1.0f, 200.0f, 5000.0f));
