/**
 * @file lfo.h
 * @brief Low Frequency Oscillator for modulating audio parameters over time.
 *
 * An LFO is structurally identical to a regular oscillator, but operates at
 * sub-audio frequencies (typically 0.01 Hz to 20 Hz). Instead of producing
 * sound directly, its output is used to modulate other parameters:
 *
 *   - Filter cutoff: makes the tone "breathe" or "sweep"
 *   - Amplitude: creates tremolo (volume wobble)
 *   - Pitch: creates vibrato (pitch wobble)
 *   - Delay time: creates chorus/flanger effects
 *   - Mix levels: slowly crossfade between textures
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE CLASS FROM OSCILLATOR?
 * ─────────────────────────────────────
 * While the math is the same, the LFO class differs in intent:
 *   - No amplitude parameter — always outputs full -1 to +1 range.
 *     The user scales the output as needed for the target parameter.
 *   - Includes reset() for syncing to tempo clocks
 *   - Default frequency is 1 Hz (not 440 Hz)
 *
 * Keeping them separate also makes code more readable: when you see `LFO`
 * you immediately know it's a modulation source, not an audio source.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   LFO filterSweep;
 *   filterSweep.setWaveform(Waveform::TRIANGLE);
 *   filterSweep.setFrequency(0.1f);  // One cycle every 10 seconds
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float mod = filterSweep.process();                    // -1.0 to +1.0
 *   float cutoff = mapf(mod, -1.0f, 1.0f, 200.0f, 3000.0f);  // Scale to Hz
 *   filter.setFrequency(cutoff);
 *
 * Waveform character for modulation:
 *   SINE     — Smooth, natural-sounding sweep
 *   TRIANGLE — Linear sweep, slightly more "mechanical" than sine
 *   SAW      — Ramp up then snap back. Good for rhythmic filter sweeps.
 *   SQUARE   — Abrupt switch between two values. Useful for alternating
 * states.

   *            0.1 Hz = one cycle every 10 seconds (slow, meditative)
   *            1.0 Hz = one cycle per second (gentle pulse)
   *            5.0 Hz = five cycles per second (vibrato speed)

   *   lfo.setFrequency(0.05f);  // Very slow: 20-second cycle

  /**
   * Set the control-rate divider — run the LFO at a fraction of audio rate.
   *
   * By default the LFO computes a new output value every audio sample
   * (divider = 1). For typical ambient LFOs (0.01–5 Hz), this is massive
   * overkill — the waveform changes so slowly that holding the same value
   * for 64 or even 256 consecutive samples is completely imperceptible.
   *
   * WHY THIS MATTERS:
   * The LFO output is often fed into SVFilter::setFrequency(), which calls
   * sinf() to recompute a filter coefficient. By downsampling the LFO,
   * you reduce those expensive sinf() calls by the same factor. For the
   * three LFOs in a typical patch, divider=64 cuts sinf() calls from
   * 3×44100/sec to 3×689/sec — a 64× reduction in filter coefficient work.
   *
   * ACCURACY:
   * The LFO's internal phase still advances by the correct amount each
   * time it fires (phaseInc_ × divider_), so the LFO frequency stays
   * exact regardless of divider. The only effect is that the output
   * value is held constant between updates — a form of sample-and-hold
   * that is inaudible for slow modulation sources.
   *
   * PRACTICAL GUIDE:
   *   divider = 1    → per-sample (default, maximum fidelity)
   *   divider = 16   → ~2756 Hz control rate (fine for vibrato up to ~5 Hz)
   *   divider = 64   → ~689 Hz control rate (ideal for filter/delay LFOs)
   *   divider = 256  → ~172 Hz control rate (fine for LFOs below ~0.5 Hz)
   *
   * @param n  Number of audio samples between LFO updates (1 = every sample)
   *
   * Example:
   *   lfo.setFrequency(0.025f);  // Very slow: 40-second cycle
   *   lfo.setDivider(256);       // Compute only 172 times/sec — plenty
