 * @file envelope.h
 * @brief Attack-Release (AR) envelope generator for shaping amplitude over
 * time.
 *
 * An envelope controls how a sound's volume changes from the moment it starts
 * to when it fades away. Without an envelope, an oscillator just drones at a
 * constant level. With one, you can create:
 *
 *   - Percussive plucks:  fast attack (1ms), short release (100ms)
 *   - Soft pads:          slow attack (2s), long release (5s)
 *   - Swells:             very slow attack (10s), slow release (10s)
 *   - Drones:             instant attack, no release (gate stays open)
 *
 * HOW AN AR ENVELOPE WORKS:
 * ────────────────────────
 * The envelope has three states:
 *
 *   IDLE → gate on → ATTACK → (reaches 1.0) → gate off → RELEASE → IDLE
 *
 *        gate on          gate off
 *          │                 │
 *   1.0    │    ┌────────────┤
 *          │   ╱             │╲
 *          │  ╱              │ ╲
 *          │ ╱               │  ╲
 *   0.0 ───┘╱                │   ╲───────
 *          │                 │
 *        attack            release
 *
 * ATTACK:  Output ramps from 0.0 to 1.0 over the attack time.
 *          While the gate is held open, output stays at 1.0 (sustain).
 * RELEASE: When the gate closes, output ramps from its current level
 *          down to 0.0 over the release time.
 *
 * The envelope output is typically multiplied with an audio signal:
 *   output = oscillator.process() * envelope.process()
 *
 * EXPONENTIAL vs LINEAR CURVES:
 * ────────────────────────────
 * This envelope uses exponential curves, which sound more natural than
 * linear ramps. Here's why:
 *
 * Human hearing is logarithmic — we perceive loudness on a log scale.
 * A linear ramp (constant change per sample) sounds like it speeds up
 * at the end of the attack and lingers too long at the start of release.
 * An exponential curve (constant ratio per sample) sounds smooth and
 * even to our ears.
 *
 * The math: each sample, we multiply the envelope value by a coefficient
 * slightly less than 1.0 (for release) or approach 1.0 from below using
 * a similar exponential formula (for attack).
 *
 * Example usage — Percussive pluck:
 *   Envelope env;
 *   env.setAttack(0.001f);    // 1 ms attack (nearly instant)
 *   env.setRelease(0.15f);    // 150 ms release (short decay)
 *
 *   // Trigger a note:
 *   env.gate(true);
 *   // ... some time later (or immediately for a pluck):
 *   env.gate(false);
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   float sample = osc.process() * env.process();
 *
 * Example usage — Slow ambient swell:
 *   Envelope env;
 *   env.setAttack(3.0f);      // 3 second fade-in
 *   env.setRelease(5.0f);     // 5 second fade-out
 *   env.gate(true);           // Start the swell
 *
 * Example usage — Drone (always on):
 *   Envelope env;
 *   env.setAttack(2.0f);      // Gentle 2-second fade-in
 *   env.setRelease(1.0f);     // Won't be used unless gate goes off
 *   env.gate(true);           // Gate on — stays at 1.0 after attack
 *
 * Example usage — Rhythmic with TempoClock:
 *   TempoClock clock(120.0f, 2);  // 120 BPM, eighth notes
 *   Envelope env;
 *   env.setAttack(0.005f);        // 5 ms
 *   env.setRelease(0.1f);         // 100 ms
 *
 *   // In audio callback:
 *   if (clock.process()) {
 *       env.gate(true);   // Trigger on each tick
 *       env.gate(false);  // Immediately release for a percussive hit
 *   }
 *   float sample = osc.process() * env.process();
